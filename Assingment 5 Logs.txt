Preparing to generate LLM response...
Debug Statement - The PROMPT is: You are a PROMPT Evaluation Assistant.
                You will receive a PROMPT written by a student. Your job is to review this PROMPT      
                and assess how well it supports structured, step-by-step reasoning in an LLM (e.g.,    
                for math, logic, planning, or tool use).

                Evaluate the prompt on the following criteria:
                1. Explicit Reasoning Instructions?
                - Does the prompt tell the model to reason step-by-step?
                - Does it include instructions like “explain your thinking” or “think before you answer”?
                2. Structured Output Format?
                - Does the prompt enforce a predictable output format (e.g., FUNCTION_CALL, JSON, numbered steps)?
                - Is the output easy to parse or validate?
                3. Separation of Reasoning and Tools?
                - Are reasoning steps clearly separated from computation or tool-use steps?
                - Is it clear when to calculate, when to verify, when to reason?
                4. Conversation Loop Support?
                - Could this prompt work in a back-and-forth (multi-turn) setting?
                - Is there a way to update the context with results from previous steps?
                5. Instructional Framing?
                - Are there examples of desired behavior or “formats” to follow?
                - Does the prompt define exactly how responses should look?
                6. Internal Self-Checks?
                - Does the prompt instruct the model to self-verify or sanity-check intermediate steps?
                7. Reasoning Type Awareness?
                - Does the prompt encourage the model to tag or identify the type of reasoning used (e.g., arithmetic, logic, lookup)?
                8. Error Handling or Fallbacks?
                - Does the prompt specify what to do if an answer is uncertain, a tool fails, or the model is unsure?
                9. Overall Clarity and Robustness?
                - Is the prompt easy to follow?
                - Is it likely to reduce hallucination and drift?

                Respond with a structured review in this format:

                Evaluate the below PROMPT. After evaluating the PROMPT, also execute the PROMPT.

                Available tools:
                {tools_description}

                You must respond with EXACTLY ONE line in one of these formats (no additional text):

                FUNCTION_CALL: function_name|param1|param2|...

                2. For final outputs:
                FINAL_ANSWER: [string value returend by the function call]

                Examples:
                - FUNCTION_CALL: draw_rectangle|10|50|10|50
                - FUNCTION_CALL: add_text_in_paint|INDIA
                - FINAL_ANSWER: open_paint function called....1111

                DO NOT include any explanations or additional text.
                Your entire response should be a single line starting with either FUNCTION_CALL: or FINAL_ANSWER:

**Execution of the Prompt:**

Assuming that the `tools_description` variable is populated with relevant information about available functions such as `open_paint`, `draw_rectangle`, and `add_text_in_paint`, the prompt would be executed as follows.

Based on the prompt's instructions to follow the given steps and examples, here's a plausible execution:

FUNCTION_CALL: open_paint
